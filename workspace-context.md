# Workspace Context & Handoff

## Project Status
2026-02-13: README.md completed with project overview, setup, development, testing, and deployment sections. Git repository initialized. Umbrella chart structure with myapp subchart in place, ready for lesson development.
2026-02-13: Completed comprehensive lesson.md with 8 lessons covering Helm fundamentals, umbrella charts, helper templates, conditionals, cross-component resources, RBAC, Azure Workload Identity, Pod Disruption Budgets, and chart publishing.
2026-02-12: Initial SPEC.md created with target solution for Helm upskill session. Defined goals around umbrella charts, abstraction, extensibility, workflows, and ArgoCD integration.
2026-02-12: Created lesson.md with Lesson 1 on creating Helm charts. Umbrella chart scaffolded. Starting Lesson 2 on umbrella chart structure.
2026-02-12: Added Lessons 3-5 covering helper templates, conditional logic, and cross-component resources.

## Key Decisions
- Focus on practical, lesson-based approach to build team confidence
- Structure around real umbrella chart development with incremental learning
- Include investigation methodology as core learning component

## Blockers / Issues
None identified yet - project just initialized.

## Investigation Notes
<!-- Key findings and discoveries -->

## Next Steps
1. Practice helm template and dry-run workflows with the completed umbrella chart
2. Implement ArgoCD integration examples for GitOps deployments
3. Test chart publishing to registries as covered in Lesson 8
4. Apply lessons to real application scenarios for hands-on experience
5. Review and refine abstraction patterns based on team feedback

## Important Findings
- Team insecurity suggests need for hands-on, guided learning approach
- Abstraction and extensibility are key focus areas for long-term maintainability
